2. Forward declarations
(Consult the lecture notes on forward declarations.)
A forward declaration allows us to tell the compiler that a function exists before it is defined
C works in a sequential order, and so it wouldn't be able to compile it otherwise
Keeps the code neat

Say you have a .c file containing five functions. What forward declarations must there be if:
(a) None of the functions call each other.
	No forward declarations
	
(b) Each function calls the next one, in order (i.e. the 1st calls the 2nd, the 2nd calls the 3rd, etc.)
	5,4,3,2,1st
	
(c) Each function calls the previous one (i.e. the 5th calls the 4th, the 4th calls the 3rd, etc.)
	No need for forward declarations
	
(d) The 1st and 5th functions both call the 2nd, 3rd and 4th.
	2,3,4th before the first function
	
(e) The 2nd, 3rd and 4th functions all call the 1st and 5th.
	1st, 5th functions have to be declared above the others
