seg fault
outside your range
you don't know what your own range is 

The #define directive sets up a macro, 
being a piece of text that gets replaced by another piece, often expanded. 
The simplest form says when you see this name, replace it with another set of characters. So it can be used in place of constants, which the original C language lacked, e.g.: 

#define PI 3.14159 
every occurrence of PI will be changed to 3.14159

its not actually c code 

Make file
Create your own 
instead of compiling all - it'll check for one 
simply a way of associating short names, called targets, 
with a series of commands to execute when the action is requested.


Benefit of pointers
passing by reference!
Use when you want to edit variable in another function
Use a copy of the address
very controlled access - unlike global variable 
can get a function to edit our variable - cant have a function retrun more than one variable

*?.txt 			//any text file that has at least one character

//List all files in the “codes” directory whose name consists of two digits, then a 
//dash, then any three characters;
ls codes/[0-9][0-9]-???
